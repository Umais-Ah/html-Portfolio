<h1>The Best Movies According to Umais</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all the times</h2>

<h3>Up</h3>
<p>
  This is my favorite animated movie. I love the theme song of this movie so
  much. This movie gives me nostalgic vibes and a sad feeling at the same time.

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
  An amazing thriller and prison movie; I love the acting. One of the first
  Hollywood movies I watched.
</p>
<h3>Into the Wild</h3>
<p>
  An adventure movie based on a true story. This movie gave me an escape from
  the real world.
